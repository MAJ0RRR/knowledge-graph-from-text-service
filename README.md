# knowledge-graph-from-text-service

A service that generates a graph of concepts from a given text, analogously to the approach described in the [article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-convert-any-text-into-a-graph-of-concepts-110844f22a1a) The service should return the graph in the form of a file (e.g. CSV) and offer the possibility of simple graph visualization. <br>
